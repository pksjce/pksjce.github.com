So, this colleague of mine, shared a link to this singly awesome web tutorial called [The Big History Project](https://www.bighistoryproject.com/). It's an amazing compilation of information on the history of universe starting right from the Big Bang Theory to the near human potention future spanning close to 13.7 billion years. 

A big undertaking, if you ask me.  

History for me is very challenging to learn because no event in the world is independent of other events. There are always dependencies and following the chain is, I've found, a pretty hard thing to do. Specialization to a single event, causation and correlation is the only effective way to study history. Not being so proficient with remembering dates, I'm always stumbling across two unrelated historical events having taken place in the same period! For example, did you know Van Gogh was painting "Starry night" while Madam Curie was experimenting with radiation?  

This was one of the awesome facts I learned on the Big History course.

The course is uniquely divided into what they call, Threshold moments. Moments in history where at certain Goldilock or just-right conditions, elements/pieces combined to form a more complex element. The idea is undoubtedly fascinating and what's even more fascinating is that they have divided the curriculum into 8 threshold moments and thus 8 lessons.  

On discovering the course, I immediately am done with the introduction and the first threshold moment, "The Big Bang". Many nuances of this theory are explained with videos, articles, slides and photographs.  

My take-away from the first lesson

1. Two scientists, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in early 1960s -in an effort to remember names and dates- heard the "hiss of the universe" on their humungous radio which is theoretically proven to be the residual energy of the big bang explosion!
2. A lady named Henrietta Leavitt had discovered a method to measure brightness and distance of stars. With this methodology, Edwin Hubble observed and discovered many such stars and thus existence of different galaxies in a state of constant motion, moving away from ours.
3. There exists a Very Large Array of radio telescopes in Chile and New Mexico which are essentially "listening" to the universe.

A key point of continuity that I have found in the lesson so far is trying to elaborate the questions of science and faith. The method so far has been to lay out historical evidences of clashes between religion and scientific discoveries and leave it to us to formulate our own thoughts on questions against spirituality as we get enlightened by scientific research. This is a slightly boring angle to me, as the religious clashes are mostly christian. My own religion, Hinduism had created a great eco system of scientific advancement. So, categorizing the insecurities of the then christianity to all religions is taking it a bit broader than needed.  

Anyhow, lets see how this course goes. 7 more chapters to go.
